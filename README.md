# update-motd.d

This is an edited and updated custom repository based off of https://github.com/yboetz/motd and a few things of my own.

To properly use these you need the following dependents.

* figlet
* lolcat
* fortune
* cowsay
* smartmontools
* Docker
* LXC
* bc (some distros don't have this installed)
* a Private Internet Acccess account
* Let's Encrypt Certs

You can easily find all of these with your distributions package manager.
